## savings_calculator
A very simple (and approximate) savings calculator, which accounts for interest of the money saved, as it is saved.

This calculator is _VERY_ approximate, and DOES NOT PROVIDE FINANCIAL ADVICE.  Use for education or entertainment (because experiencing the magic of compound interest through abstract numbers on a screen is extremely informative and entertaining! :D).
